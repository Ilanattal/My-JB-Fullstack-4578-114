    <h4>Why Ilan's Food ? </h4>

    <h5>Our advices to your weight loss :</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Eat a balanced diet: Prioritize nutrient-rich foods, such as vegetables, fruits, lean proteins (fish, chicken, tofu), and good fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil). Limit processed foods and foods high in added sugars.</li>
        <li>Hydrate: Drinking water before meals can help reduce appetite and prevent dehydration, often confused with hunger. Try to drink around 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day.</li>
        <li>Exercise regularly: Combine cardio training (like walking, running, or swimming) with muscle-strengthening exercises (like weight training or yoga) to increase your metabolism and burn more calories.</li>
        <li>Be patient and persistent: Weight loss is a process that takes time. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Stay motivated and focus on your overall well-being.</li>
